# Modal-analysis-of-a-cracked-portal-frame-carrying-a-roving-mass

MATLAB code for a cracked portal frame carrying a roving mass (natural frequency calculation)

Both the rotary inertia and the translational inertia of the roving mass are considered.

The natural frequency calculation for a cracked portal frame carrying a roving mass. 

Roving means the velocity of the mass is not considered. 

Whenever the mass is located in a new position, the natural frequency is calculated. 

The crack is on the middle member of the frame. 

The dynamic stiffness method is used. 

The Wittrick-Williams algorithm is employed to search for natural frequencies. 

Timoshenko beam theory and Rayleigh bar theory are combined.
